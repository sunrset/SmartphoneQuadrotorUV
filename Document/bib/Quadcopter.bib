@book{Tomas2011,
abstract = {Recent development in the fields of MEMS sensors, miniature, energy efficient and very powerful microcontrollers and microprocessors has given the opportunity to build small autonomous flying vehicles. This thesis is studying one type of these vehicles, so called quadrotor. The quadrotor is flying vehicle similar to helicopter but having four rotors which are situated in one plane. Each propeller is actuated by an independently controlled motor. This feature allows to control Euler angles of the quadrotor such as yaw, pitch and roll thus giving the possibility to control quadrotor's position and velocity. The CTU Department of Cybernetics bought such a quadrotor prototype called Linkquad. The goal is to use this prototype for indoor flights using camera vision as a navigation reference. Unfortunately the prototype has no autonomous control loops implemented. The focal point of this thesis is design of a control law for the already mentioned prototype. This leads to other tasks such as an identification of the models 's parameters, creating mathematical nonlinear model, linearization of this model in certain trim points, design and testing of the linear controller and finally implementation and testing using the real system.},

A three simple test rigs are built and used to identify the relationship between the motor input Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signal and the angular velocity, the thrust force, and drag moment of the rotors. A simple algorithm is implemented to an inertial measurement unit (IMU) for estimating the attitude and altitude of the quadrotor. Experimental set up is built to verify and test the accuracy of these proposed techniques.

abstract = {In this work, a mathematical model of a quadrotor's dynamics is derived, using Newton's and Euler's laws. A linearized version of the model is obtained, and therefore a linear controller, the Linear Quadratic Regulator, is derived. After that, two feedback linearization control schemes are designed. The first one is the dynamic inversion with zero dynamics stabilization, based on Static Feedback Linearization obtaining a partial linearization of the mathematical model. The second one is the exact linearization and non-interacting control via dynamic feedback, based on Dynamic Feedback Linearization obtaining a total linearization of the mathematical model. Moreover, these nonlinear control strategies are compared with the Linear Quadratic Regulator in terms of performances. Finally, the behavior of the quadrotor under the proposed control strategies is observed in virtual reality by using the Simulink 3D Animation toolbox},

abstract = {This thesis is about modelling, design and control of Miniature Flying Robots (MFR) with a focus on Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) systems and specifically, micro quadrotors. It introduces a mathematical model for simu- lation and control of such systems. It then describes a design methodology for a miniature rotorcraft. The methodology is subsequently applied to design an autonomous quadrotor named OS4. Based on the mathematical model, linear and nonlinear control techniques are used to design and simulate var- ious controllers along this work. The dynamic model and the simulator evolved from a simple set of equa- tions, valid only for hovering, to a complex mathematical model with more realistic aerodynamic coefficients and sensor and actuator models. Two platforms were developed during this thesis. The first one is a quadrotor- like test-bench with off-board data processing and power supply. It was used to safely and easily test control strategies. The second one, OS4, is a highly integrated quadrotor with on-board data processing and power supply. It has all the necessary sensors for autonomous operation. Five different controllers were developed. The first one, based on Lyapunov theory, was applied for attitude control. The second and the third controllers are based on PID and LQ techniques. These were compared for attitude con- trol. The fourth and the fifth approaches use backstepping and sliding-mode concepts. They are applied to control attitude. Finally, backstepping is aug- mented with integral action and proposed as a single tool to design attitude, altitude and position controllers. This approach is validated through various flight experiments conducted on the OS4.},

@article{Mahlein2013,
abstract = {Spectral vegetation indices (SVIs) have been shown to be useful for an indirect detection of plant diseases. However, these indices have not been evaluated to detect or to differentiate between plant diseases on crop plants. The aim of this study was to develop specific spectral disease indices (SDIs) for the detection of diseases in crops. Sugar beet plants and the three leaf diseases Cercospora leaf spot, sugar beet rust and powdery mildew were used as model system. Hyperspectral signatures of healthy and diseased sugar beet leaves were assessed with a non-imaging spectroradiometer at different developing stages and disease severities of pathogens. Significant and most relevant wavelengths and two band normalized differences from 450 to 950. nm, describing the impact of a disease on sugar beet leaves were extracted from the data-set using the RELIEF-F algorithm. To develop hyperspectral indices for the detection of sugar beet diseases the best weighted combination of a single wavelength and a normalized wavelength difference was exhaustively searched testing all possible combinations. The optimized disease indices were tested for their ability to detect and to classify healthy and diseased sugar beet leaves. With a high accuracy and sensitivity healthy sugar beet leaves and leaves, infected with Cercospora leaf spot, sugar beet rust and powdery mildew were classified (balanced classification accuracy: 89{\%}, 92{\%}, 87{\%}, 85{\%}, respectively). Spectral disease indices were also successfully applied on hyperspectral imaging data and on non-imaging data from a sugar beet field. Specific disease indices will improve disease detection, identification and monitoring in precision agriculture applications. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {A major limitation of existing battery-powered quadrotor UAVs is their reduced flight endurance. To address this issue, by leveraging the electrical model of a brushless DC motor, we explicitly determine minimum-energy paths between a predefined initial and final configuration of a quadrotor by solving an optimal control problem with respect to the angular accelerations of the four propellers. As a variation on this problem, if the total energy consumption between two boundary states is fixed, minimum-time and/or minimumcontrol-effort trajectories are computed for the aerial vehicle. The theory is illustrated for the DJI Phantom 2 quadrotor in three realistic scenarios.},

@inproceedings{Cappello2015,
abstract = {In order for Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) to coexist seamlessly with manned aircraft in non-segregated airspace, enhanced navigational capabilities are essential to meet the Required Navigational Performance (RNP) levels in all flight phases. A Multi-Sensor Data Fusion (MSDF) framework is adopted to improve the navigation capabilities of an integrated Navigation and Guidance System (NGS) designed for small-sized RPAS. The MSDF architecture includes low-cost and low weight/volume navigation sensors suitable for various classes of RPAS. The selected sensors include Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) based Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and Vision Based Sensors (VBS). A loosely integrated navigation architecture is presented where an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) is used to combine the navigation sensor measurements. The presented UKF based VBS-INS-GNSS-ADM (U-VIGA) architecture is an evolution of previous research performed on Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) based VBS-INS-GNSS (E-VIGA) systems. An Aircraft Dynamics Model (ADM) is adopted as a virtual sensor and acts as a knowledge-based module providing additional position and attitude information, which is pre-processed by an additional/local UKF. The E-VIGA and U-VIGA performances are evaluated in a small RPAS integration scheme (i.e., AEROSONDE RPAS platform) by exploring a representative cross-section of this RPAS operational flight envelope. The position and attitude accuracy comparison shows that the E-VIGA and U-VIGA systems fulfill the relevant RNP criteria, including precision approach in CAT-II. A novel Human Machine Interface (HMI) architecture is also presented, whose design takes into consideration the coordination tasks of multiple human operators. In addition, the interface scheme incorporates the human operator as an integral part of the control loop providing a higher level of situational awareness.},

abstract = {This thesis work focused on the study of a quadrotor helicopter. The dynamic system modelling and the control algorithm evaluation were carried out. To test the results, a simulator and a real platform were developed. The Newton-Euler formalism was used to model the dynamic system. Particular attention was given to the group composed of the DC-motor, the gear box and the propeller which needed also the estimation of aerodynamic lift and torque to reach better accuracy. PID control algorithms were compared. The first stage tests were performed on a simulated model where it was easy to evaluate the performance with a mathematical approach. The second stage tests were carried out on the quadrotor platform to evaluate the behavior of the real system. A simulator based on Matlab-Simulink was developed. With this program it was possible to test the accuracy of the model and the robustness of the control algorithms. Furthermore a 3D graphic output and a joystick interface made easier the testability and the observability of the system. A quadrotor platform was developed. The electronics was composed of a Micro Control Unit (MCU) interfaced with several devices: the power supply, the receiving unit, the DC-motor power boards, the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), the SONAR and the IR modules. Thanks to these devices and the MCU software, both guided and autonomous flights were possible.},

@article{Mulla2013,
abstract = {Precision agriculture dates back to the middle of the 1980's. Remote sensing applications in precision agriculture began with sensors for soil organic matter, and have quickly diversified to include satellite, aerial, and hand held or tractor mounted sensors. Wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation initially focused on a few key visible or near infrared bands. Today, electromagnetic wavelengths in use range from the ultraviolet to microwave portions of the spectrum, enabling advanced applications such as light detection and ranging (LiDAR), fluorescence spectroscopy, and thermal spectroscopy, along with more traditional applications in the visible and near infrared portions of the spectrum. Spectral bandwidth has decreased dramatically with the advent of hyperspectral remote sensing, allowing improved analysis of specific compounds, molecular interactions, crop stress, and crop biophysical or biochemical characteristics. A variety of spectral indices now exist for various precision agriculture applications, rather than a focus on only normalised difference vegetation indices. Spatial resolution of aerial and satellite remote sensing imagery has improved from 100's of m to sub-metre accuracy, allowing evaluation of soil and crop properties at fine spatial resolution at the expense of increased data storage and processing requirements. Temporal frequency of remote sensing imagery has also improved dramatically. At present there is considerable interest in collecting remote sensing data at multiple times in order to conduct near real time soil, crop and pest management. {\textcopyright} 2012 IAgrE.},

The ANMODAP receives data from a large number of remote neutron monitor (NM) stations, provided in real time over the Internet, together with satellite data. Through this project, the ANMODAP forecasting capability will be increased with the collection of data at high atmospheric altitudes over Greece by the LET radiation spectrometer, carried on the specially designed UAV. The advantages of this spectrometer are its very small dimensions, light weight, and low power consumption. The UAV, powered from photovoltaic generators, flying at high altitudes with propellers on small electrical motors, and carrying simple networking equipment, will achieve long range telecommunication links with a terrestrial footprint larger than the area of Greece.},

abstract = {This paper presents real-time guidance strategies for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that can be used to enhance their flight endurance by utilizing {\{}$\backslash$sl insitu{\}} measurements of wind speeds and wind gradients. In these strategies, periodic adjustments would be made in the airspeed and/or heading angle command for the UAV to minimize a projected power requirement at some future time. In this paper, UAV flights are described by a three-dimensional dynamic point-mass. Onboard closed-loop trajectory tracking logics that follow airspeed vector commands are modeled using the method of feedback linearization. A generic wind field model is assumed that consists of a constant term plus terms that vary sinusoidally with respect to the location. To evaluate the benefits of these strategies in enhancing UAV flight endurance, a reference strategy is introduced in which the UAV would seek to follow the desired airspeed in a steady level flight under zero wind. A performance measure is defined as the average power consumption both over a specified time interval and over different initial heading angles of the UAV. A relative benefit criterion is then defined as the percentage improvement of the performance measure of a proposed strategy over that of the reference strategy. Extensive numerical simulations are conducted. Results demonstrate the benefits and trends of power savings of the proposed real-time guidance strategies.},

abstract = {Recently, there has been a rapid growth of interest in quadrotors with electric variable-pitch propellers. The control and optimization of such propellers are important factors for improving the flight performance of the vehicles. Therefore, the steady-state identification method to estimate the parameters of the mathematical model of the electric variable-pitch propeller is developed. The steady-state control and optimization scheme with minimum power consumption and the adaptive compensation scheme for the variable-pitch propeller are then proposed, based on which the response performance of the lift force produced by the variable-pitch propeller can be greatly improved by using a cascade compensation scheme. Furthermore, the direct lift-based flight control strategy is presented, which can significantly contribute to the improvement of the flight performance, precisely because the roll, pitch, yaw and vertical channels of the variable-pitch quadrotor are approximately linearized and completely decoupled from each other in this case. The experimental results demonstrate that both the endurance performance and the positioning accuracy of the variable-pitch quadrotor are improved simultaneously by using the proposed method with minimum power consumption.},

The airborne spectrometer is wirelessly synchronized to a second spectrometer on the ground for simultaneous white reference collection. In this paper, the performance of the system is investigated and specific issues such as dark current correction or second order effects are addressed. Full width at half maximum was between 2.4 and 3.0 nm depending on the spectral band. The functional system was tested in flight at a 10-m altitude against a current field spectroscopy gold standard device Analytical Spectral Devices Field Spec 4 over an agricultural site. A highly significant correlation (r 2 {\textgreater} 0.99) was found in reflection comparing both measurement approaches. Furthermore, the aerial measurements have a six times smaller standard deviation than the hand held measurements. Thus, the present spectrometer opens a possibility for low-cost but high- precision field spectroscopy from UAVs.},

The topic of the paper is in particular the application of this solution to dynamics sensing in a quadrotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). The attitude estimation is based on an Explicit Complementary Filter (ECF). The position estimation is implemented through a complementary filter using acceleration readings provided by the smartphone sensors and the position derived by a vision based motion capture system. The parameters of the algorithms are tuned through the minimisation of the estimation error for sets of sample acquisitions. Moreover, these settings are chosen in order to minimise the issues related with the fact that Android is not a Real Time Operating System (RTOS). Finally, it was verified that the chosen solution provides performances adequate to the quadrotor stabilisation. The results of a set of experimental tests are used to show the performances of the proposed solution. For the attitude estimation algorithm, a comparison is moreover provided in order to highlight the difference with standard Android orientation estimation algorithm.},

@article{Milton2006,
abstract = {This paper reviews developments in the science of field spectroscopy, focusing on the last twenty years in particular. During this period field spectroscopy has become established as an important technique for characterising the reflectance of natural surfaces in situ, for supporting the vicarious calibration of airborne and satellite sensors, and for providing a means of scaling-up measurements from small areas (e.g. leaves, rocks) to composite scenes (e.g. vegetation canopies), and ultimately to pixels. This paper describes the physical basis of the subject and evaluates the different methods and instruments which have been employed across a range of studies. The development and use of field goniometers is described, and related to methods for estimating the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) from directional reflectance measurements in the field. The paper also considers the practical aspects of field spectroscopy, and identifies a number of factors affecting the useability of field spectroradiometers, including the weight and cost of the instruments, limitations of some commonly used methodologies and practical issues such as the legibility of displays and limited battery life. The prospects for the future of field spectroscopy are considered in relation to the increasingly important contribution that field spectral data will make to EO-based global measurement and monitoring systems, specifically through their assimilation into numerical models. However, for this to be achieved it is essential that the data are of high quality, with stated levels of accuracy and uncertainty, and that common protocols are developed and maintained to ensure the long-term value of field spectroscopic data. The importance of employing a precise terminology for describing the geometric configuration of measurements is highlighted in relation to issues of repeatability and reproducibility. Through such refinements in methodology, field spectroscopy will establish its credentials as a reliable method of environmental measurement, underpinning quantitative Earth observation and its applications in the environmental and Earth sciences. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

We develop an algorithm that enables the real-time generation of optimal trajectories through a sequence of 3-D positions and yaw angles, while ensuring safe passage through specified corridors and satisfying constraints on velocities, accelerations and inputs. A nonlinear controller ensures the faithful tracking of these trajectories.

abstract = {Quadrotors are well suited for executing fast maneu- vers with high accelerations but they are still unable to follow a fast trajectory with centimeter accuracy without iteratively learning it beforehand. In this paper, we present a novel body-rate controller and an iterative thrust-mixing scheme, which improve the trajectory-tracking performance without requiring learning and reduce the yaw control error of a quadrotor, respectively. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, we present the first algorithm to cope with motor saturations smartly by prioritizing control inputs which are relevant for stabilization and trajectory tracking. The presented body-rate controller uses LQR-control methods to consider both the body rate and the single motor dynamics, which reduces the overall trajectory-tracking error while still rejecting external disturbances well. Our iterative thrust-mixing scheme computes the four rotor thrusts given the inputs from a position-control pipeline. Through the iterative computation, we are able to consider a varying ratio of thrust and drag torque of a single propeller over its input range, which allows applying the desired yaw torque more precisely and hence reduces the yaw-control error. Our prioritizing motor-saturation scheme improves stability and robustness of a quadrotor's flight and may prevent unstable behavior in case of motor saturations. We demonstrate the improved trajectory tracking, yaw-control, and robustness in case of motor saturations in real-world exper- iments with a quadrotor.},

abstract = {With the huge advancements in miniature sensors, actuators and processors depend- ing mainly on the Micro and Nano-Electro-Mechanical-Systems (MEMS/NEMS), many researches are now focusing on developing miniature flying vehicles to be used in both research and commercial applications. This thesis work presents a detailed mathematical model for a Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) type Unmanned Aerial Vehicle(UAV) known as the quadrotor. The nonlinear dynamic model of the quadrotor is formulated using the Newton-Euler method, the formulated model is detailed including aerodynamic effects and rotor dynamics that are omitted in many literature. The motion of the quadrotor can be divided into two subsystems; a rotational subsystem (attitude and heading) and a translational subsystem (altitude and x and y motion). Although the quadrotor is a 6 DOF underactuated system, the derived rotational subsystem is fully actuated, while the translational subsystem is underactuated. The derivation of the mathematical model is followed by the development of four control approaches to control the altitude, attitude, heading and position of the quadrotor in space. The first approach is based on the linear Proportional-Derivative- Integral (PID) controller. The second control approach is based on the nonlinear Sliding Mode Controller (SMC). The third developed controller is a nonlinear Back- stepping controller while the fourth is a Gain Scheduling based PID controller. The parameters and gains of the forementioned controllers were tuned using Ge- netic Algorithm (GA) technique to improve the systems dynamic response. Simula- tion based experiments were conducted to evaluate and compare the performance of the four developed control techniques in terms of dynamic performance, stability and the effect of possible disturbances.

abstract = {This work shows the development of an Android app as a tool for learning concepts of automatic control and dynamic systems. For this purpose, an App to simulate a closed loop control for a mass-spring-damper system was implemented for Android devices. In this closed loop control, the plant and the controller can work together in the same device. This operation type is called stand-alone mode. Another option is to simulate in different devices the controller and the plant. This operation type is called remote mode. A fourth-order Runge-Kutta was used as a numerical method for solving the differential equations of the controller and the plant whichever the operation mode is used. The results of the solution of the differential equation were used to visualize the relevant variables of the system at time domain (position of the mass, control action and reference) and to create an animation. The App allows the plant and the controller to be parameterized independently. Besides, the App lets the user generate perturbations to the controlled system using the device's touch screen or its proximity sensor.},

@article{Haboudane2008,
abstract = {This paper examines the use of simulated and mea- sured canopy reflectance for chlorophyll estimation over crop can- opies. Field spectral measurements were collected over corn and wheat canopies in different intensive field campaigns organized during the growing seasons of 2004 and 2005. They were used to test and evaluate several combined indices for chlorophyll determination using hyperspectral imagery (Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager). Several index combinations were inves- tigated using both PROSPECT–SAILH canopy simulated spectra and field-measured reflectances. The relationships between leaf chlorophyll content and combined optical indices have shown similar trends for both PROSPECT–SAILH simulated data and ground-measured data sets, which indicates that both spectral measurements and radiative transfer models hold comparable potential for the quantitative retrieval of crop foliar pigments. The data set used has shown that crop type had a clear influence on the establishment of predictive equations as well as on their valida- tion. In addition to generating different predictive equations, corn and wheat data yielded contrasting agreement between estimated and measured chlorophyll contents even for the same predictive algorithm. Among the set of indices tested in this paper, index combinations like Modified Chlorophyll Absorption Ratio Index/ Optimized Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (OSAVI), Triangular Chlorophyll Index/OSAVI, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spec- trometer Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index/Improved Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (MSAVI), and Red-Edge Model/MSAVI seem to be relatively consistent and more stable as estimators of crop chlorophyll content.},

abstract = {Point-of-care (POC) diagnostics integrated with smartphone platform has gained increasing attention in recent years due to its portability, cost-effectiveness and user-friendly setting. In this paper, we present an optical sensor based on a smartphone platform with extremely low-cost spectrometer accessary, which can be applied for colorimetric sensing. The spectrometer accessory enables separation and quantification of color information from various samples, which are essential in many colorimetric and fluorescence-based detections. The proposed smartphone based optical sensor consists of LED as excitation light source, assembled spectrometer structure and transparent fluidic sensing chamber for liquid analyte. The functionality of this smartphone based optical sensor is proved by applying it for pH sensing, realized by injecting standard pH buffer solution into the fluidic sensing chamber prefilled with pH indicator dye. The color change of pH indicator in the sensing chamber can be distinguished by the imbedded spectrometer and the spectrum image can be captured using external smartphone camera without the need for expensive camera. Image-processing software is employed to obtain quantitative pH sensing result. In general, this smartphone based optical sensor can be used for any colorimetric sensors in food, agriculture and medicine. Furthermore, the cost of the sensor can be further reduced by replacing the sensing chamber with test strips, such as the ones made from paper, making it a highly practical sensing device for resource-limited settings.},

abstract = {The rescue missions during disasters and coastal distress have been really under a great risk because of the lack of earlier knowledge about the upcoming hazard. During disasters the main problem is that we can't reach the specific area at exact time, due to the vulnerability, and we have lost a lot of people. But this is possible with real time GPS 3D surveillance. This can be done on the basis of generic term we use GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) for these satellite systems. Here we use these principles to screen the emergency scenario in the surveillance aircraft which have been in the process of surveillance at disaster prone areas. In such emergency scenario, a surveillance aircraft reports back to mission control. Under the accordance to the commands given by the mission control, the surveillance aircraft, which has the quadcopters, will start the rescue mission henceforth. The quadcopter which is on board to perform rescue mission is capable of producing enough thrust to lift the victims. Hence this criterion should be satisfied by specific propeller motors and respective propellers with required strength. Different UAVs can then perform rescue operations or monitor the situation. The rescue operations in UAVs are done by isolating the human.},
